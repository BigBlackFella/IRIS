For jUnit testing there is a single simulated bank. Within the bank there are three cores called 'ShardEntity', 'Entity1' and 'Entity2'. These are based on Customer and
Account but they are NOT 'Customer' or 'Account'. The field names are only for test and do not need to be in sync with real world entities.
